# C# Extras

- [Recordset](Recordset.md) - Gives you much of the ADODB feel without changing too much.  Also can be customized to extend.
- [FixedWidthRecord](FixedWidthRecord.md) - A stand-in mapper to handle any 'fixed-length' records, common to VB6.
- [CsvRecord](FixedWidthRecord.md) - Built from the same base as the `FixedWidthRecord`, provides a common interface to read/write CSV files.
